A-1 Launch 10000 async requests on N = 3 server containers and report the request count handled by each server instance in a bar chart. Explain your observations in the graph 
    and your view on the performance.
    
A-2 Next, increment N from 2 to 6 and launch 10000 requests on each such increment. Report the average load of the servers at each run in a line chart. Explain your observations 
    in the graph and your view on the scalability of the load balancer implementation
    
A-3 Test all endpoints of the load balancer and show that in case of server failure, the load balancer spawns a new instance quickly to handle the load.

A-4 Finally, modify the hash functions H(i), Î¦(i, j) and report the observations from (A-1) and (A-2).
